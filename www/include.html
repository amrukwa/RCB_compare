<div align="justify">Treatment Efficacy Score (TES) can capture the relative efficacy of one treatment (e.g. experimental treatment) over the other (e.g. standard of care) by analyzing the distribution of&nbsp;continuous Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score. We developed three independent methods to&nbsp;calculate TES, that could be tested here.</div>
<br>
<b>Residual Cancer Burden could be calculated <a href="http://www3.mdanderson.org/app/medcalc/index.cfm?pagename=jsconvert3" target="_blank">here</a>.</b> 
<br>
<b>The applied R scripts are available <a href="https://github.com/mmarczyk363/RCB_compare" target="_blank">here</a>.</b>
